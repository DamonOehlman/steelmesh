Why Use Steelmesh?
==================

Steelmesh has primarily been designed for hosting "behind the firewall" node applications in, dare I say it, enterprise environments.  It really hasn't been designed for your next gazillion user startup or other such `webscale`__ deployments.

What Steelmesh does do a bang up job on though, is making working with horizontally scaled, homogeneous clusters, really easy.  Heck it's almost fun.
