Steelmesh is a [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) development / deployment platform
that works in conjunction with [CouchDB](http://couchdb.apache.org) to keep
applications up to date and in sync.

## Why Use Steelmesh?

Steelmesh has primarily been designed for hosting "behind the firewall" node
applications in, dare I say it, enterprise environments.  It really hasn't been
designed for your next gazillion user startup or other such "webscale"
deployments.

What Steelmesh does do a bang up job on though, is making working with
horizontally scaled, homogeneous clusters, really easy.  Heck it's almost fun.
