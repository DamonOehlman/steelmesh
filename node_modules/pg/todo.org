14:03 <isaacs> brianc: it might also be nice to wrap that build
               command up in a shell script, so that you can do
               `npm config set pg:require-native true` and then
               test for $npm_package_config_require_native=="true"
               in your script

14:04 <brianc> isaacs: so that way if libpq bindings doon't build
               the install fails?

14:04 <isaacs> brianc: the reason i suggest that is that i'm doing
               some work to be able to pre-build binary packages
               for specific arch's, and pre-built packages wont'
               run their preinstall/install scripts.  so, if it
               succeeds, but trivially, i probably don't want to
               have a "prebuilt" version that didn't actually build
               anythign
14:04 <isaacs> brianc: yeah

14:04 <brianc> wink_: just did benchmark on my crap 512meg linode:
               pure javascript 1000 simple queries in 726
               milliseconds; libpq bindings 1000 simple queries in
               585 milliseconds
14:05 <isaacs> node-waf configure build || ! [
               "$npm_package_config_require_native" = "true" ]
14:05 <isaacs> could even do it in a one-liner like that^
